Lightweight visualizer/debugger of 3D data

# Build Steps:

# Modify these paths in CMakeLists.txt to where you've installed the libraries
set(GLFW_ROOT "C:/Devel/glfw-3.3.8.bin.WIN64")
set(GLEW_ROOT "C:/Devel/glew-2.1.0")
set(GLM_ROOT "C:/Devel/glm")

Copy imgui (imgui-1.91.4.zip should certainly work) to SceneDebugger root directory
